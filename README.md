# https://glacier-modding.github.io/g2-mods/

A work in progress website dedicated to hosting/documenting modifications for Glacier² Engine games, since IO don't wanna release modification tools for some illogical reason.
	- HITMAN
	- HITMAN 2
	- Deus Ex Mankind Dividied
	- Hitman Absolutution

HITMAN 2 is the main focus at the moment, but modifications will likely hopefully end up expanding to all Glacier² Engine games, more work pls @B3LYP & @MrMike <3

I've started work on this but may hit points of procrasination during building the website. Bare with me on our journey to success.
