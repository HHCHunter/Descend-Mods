# g2-mods.com

A work in progress website dedicated to hosting/documenting modifications for Glacier² Engine games.

- HITMAN
- HITMAN 2
- Deus Ex: Mankind Divided
- Hitman: Absolution

HITMAN 2 is the main focus at the moment, but modifications will likely hopefully end up expanding to all Glacier² Engine games, more work pls @B3LYP & @MrMike <3

I've started work on this website but may hit points of procrasination during building the website. 
Bare with me on our journey to success.

## TODO: 
- Add a how to submit a mod page.
	- Figure out how exactly that is going to work, would be great to have mods submitted as github pull requests.
	- Figure out a solution to the long static page issue this would cause
	    - Possibly may need a backend to serve mod pages :(
	
- Start adding a few trivial mods to start things off.

- Talk to Mike about a Mod Manager
	- Distrobution of mods should be done via Zip files, with a json / xml manifest, swixel has concept for something like this.

- Talk Swixel into helping out Mike

- Talk to B3 about Mods in general
- Start adding trivial mods
